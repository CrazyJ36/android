    <string name="bigText">C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion</string>
    <string name="bigText2">C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portable-ly written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded micro-controllers to supercomputers.</string>

    <string name="dialogTv1Txt">Before getting started with C programming, lets get familiarized with the language first. C is a general-purpose
programming language used for wide range of applications from Operating systems like Windows and iOS to software that is used for creating 3D movies.
C programming is highly efficient. That’s the main reason why it’s very popular despite being more than 40 years old. Standard C programs are portable.
The source code written in one system works in another operating system without any change. As mentioned, it’s a good language to start learning
programming. If you know C programming, you will not just understand how your program works, but will also be able to create a mental picture
on how a computer works.</string>
    <string name="dialogTv2Txt">\nIf you know C, you will not only know how your program works but, you will be able to create a mental model
on how a computer works (including memory management and allocation). You will learn to appreciate the freedom that C provides unlike Python and Java.
Understanding C allows you to write programs that you never thought were possible before (or at the very least, you will have a broader understanding
of computer architecture and programming as a whole).</string>
