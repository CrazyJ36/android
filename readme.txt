# TODO:
- put simple project examples in /docs

# Usage of repo
- Try to keep projects cli-based, using Androids' native platform APIs' instead of AppCompat or Support Library.
- In order to work with cli-build source code in Android Studio for auto-complete reference,
  use Android Studios' 'import from existing source' option on welcome screen.
