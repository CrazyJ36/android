# TODO:
- remove anything but required from adb-remote
- organize /android/projects/ possibly put examples in /docs
- clone files to new dir, delete .git, delete repo from bitbucket, re make repo (free space)


# Usage of repo
- Try to keep projects cli-based, using Androids' native platform APIs' instead of AppCompat or Support Library.

- In order to work with cli-build source code in Android Studio for auto-complete reference,
  use Android Studios' 'import from existing source' option on welcome screen.
